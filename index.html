    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Sunday</strong>. Your privacy is our top priority. Because we believe in total transparency, we want you to know exactly how your data is handled.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The Short Version:</strong> Sunday does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data. Everything you create stays on your device.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information. Unlike other apps, Sunday does not require an account, an email address, or a phone number to function. We have no access to your tasks, events, or settings.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into Sunday (Tasks, Events, and Theme Preferences) is stored locally on your device using a secure internal database. This data is never uploaded to a cloud server or transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app uses system-level tools to display the correct time and date. Sunday does not track your GPS location or access your contacts, photos, or microphone.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Sunday does not use third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising networks. There are no "cookies" used within the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since your data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can delete all your data at any time through the "Settings" menu within the app, or by simply uninstalling the application from your device.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. However, our core philosophy of "No Data Collection" will remain the same. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
